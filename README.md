# Data.FI Anomaly Finder

This repository holds scripts for the Data.FI Anomaly Finder, a project to create a tool that applies Recommender systems and Time Series to identify anomalies in PEPFAR Monitoring Evaluation and Reporting data. This is a private repository for Palladium and USAID staff.

The tool has gone through multiple iterations. The initial version consisted of a set of R scripts and packrat bundle that had to be downloaded and run locally. The current version is deployed as web app via R shiny. For those with access to PEPFAR's PRIME server, the relevant codebase in located in the PRIME directory. For those accessing the tool via shinyapps.io, the relevant code is located in the App folder. Note that those accessing the application from within PRIME can select country data from a dropdown. Those using the tool via shinyapps.io will need to provide and upload their own MER dataset. 

For any questions, please contact the author at Jonathan.Friedman@thepalladiumgroup.com.
